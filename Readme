Note: The following installation instructions install the FlameMaster program
to ~/FlameMaster and are based on the use of csh, tcsh, or bash. If you are
using a different environment or want to install in a different location
appropriate changes have to be made in the Install script or after
installation.

1.  Rename the FlameMaster archive to ~/FlameMaster  . If you prefer a different location for the
FlameMaster package, rename the FlameMaster folder appropriately and change the path
in FlameManExports.csh or FlameManExports.bash (see installation step 2). The description
below assumes the location to be ~/FlameMaster. If you choose a different location, some
of the commands have to be changed appropriately.

2.  If you are using csh, tcsh, copy the file
~/FlameMaster/FlameManExports.csh to ~/.FlameManExports.csh. If you are using
bash, copy the file ~/FlameMaster/FlameManExports.bash to
~/.FlameManExports.bash

3.  If you are using csh, tcsh, add the line source
~/.FlameManExports.csh to the file ~/.cshrc. If you are using bash,
 add the line source ~/.FlameManExports.bash to the file ~/.bashrc.

4.  Choose the correct settings for flex and the machine in the file
~/.FlameManExports.csh or in ~/.FlameManExports.bash, if you are using
bash.

5.  Source the file ~/.FlameManExports.csh or ~/.cshrc if you are using csh, or
source the file ~/.FlameManExports.bash or ~/.bashrc. You can do this, for instance,
by executing the command

source ~/.FlameManExports.csh

Instead, you can also log out and in again. It is important to do that in the shell you are using. The
installation script and all other scripts and programs invoked won't recognize
the variables defined in the .FlameManExports.{whateveryouuse} file otherwise.

6.  If flex is not installed on the machine and the second flex option in
~/.FlameManExports.{whateveryouuse} has been used, install flex now using the
commands chmod 755 ~/FlameMaster/InstallFlex ~/FlameMaster/InstallFlex

7.  Choose the correct machine settings in the file
~/FlameMaster/FlameManTools/ListTool/FLReader/Makefile 
I have problems to install the ListTool package on SGIs, but ListTool is not essential, although
very helpful.

8.  To install the package, use the script Install.csh or Install.bash depending on the shell
you are using. Change the file mode of this script to executable by performing, for instance the command

chmod 755 ~/FlameMaster/Install.csh

9. Install package using the command 

~/FlameMaster/Install.csh

or 

~/FlameMaster/Install.bash
 
depending on your shell. Make sure that your
current shell is newer than installation step 4 or you properly executed step 5.

10. Check out some examples in ~/FlameMaster/FlameManRun. In each directory under
FlameManRun, look at the Readme files, if present. These have descriptions of how
to run the code and pre- and post-process the data. Also some additional helpful 
features are documented in the Readme files. Start with
~/FlameMaster/FlameManRun/Diff/Steady/H2. Then go
to ~/FlameMaster/FlameManRun/Diff/Steady/CH4 and look at the Readme file.
Continue through the other examples.
Note that if the FlameMaster program is not installed in ~/FlameMaster, you have 
to change the path to the mechanism files appropriately in the input files.

For the generation of flamelet libraries, look at the file ~/Documentation/FlameletLibraries.pdf

Another good exercise is to convert the GRI2.11 mechanism from chemkin to
FlameMaster format. This is described in ~/FlameMaster/FlameManTools/CK2FMReinh
in a Readme file.

11. If you come across any problems during the installation, please send me the
complete output of running the install script the FlameMaster relevant results
of just typing the command 'env' and I can try to give you some clues.
